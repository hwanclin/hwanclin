# About me


Please visit my [Github website](https://hwanclin.github.io) for more details about me.

- I am a full professor of economics & mathematical Finance at UNC-Charlotte. 
- As a computational economist, I've focused research on innovation, finance, growth, and macroeconomic dynamics.
- My major contributions from economic research are as follows: 
- First, I've proposed and demonstrated a novel, Pareto-efficient alternative to patents called "Innovation-backed Amortizing Securities. This contribution can resolve the real-worl problems with medical patents intertwined with hefty drug prices.
- Second, my research has introduced novel numerical methods for solving macroeconomic dynamics driven by functional differential equations (FDEs). This contribution can help resolve a critical computational problem that has bothered economists for decades.
- Third, my research has shown how central banks can establish forward-rate target Zones to stabilize foreign exchange rates in a stochastic economic environment.
- My current project is to show how to design a novel class of amortizing scurities, called "Innovation-Backed Securities" (IBS), that can function as a socially optimal mechanism to reward innovation while eliminating patent-created monopolies in a variety-based endogenous growth model.
- I enjoy programming in Python and playing online Go game.
